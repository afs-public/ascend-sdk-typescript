It is calculated by subtracting positions with pending restrictions from the total settled amount (currently: settled - (pending_outgoing_acat + pending_drip + pending_withdrawal)). As new memo location categories are added to the API, Apex may update this calculation to incorporate these values. Note that the Cash and Margin systems may place additional restrictions on cash/ assets according to their business logic. | {<br/>"value": "0.25"<br/>}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
