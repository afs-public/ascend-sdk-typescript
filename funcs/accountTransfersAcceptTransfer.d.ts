 * Accept Transfer

 * Accept one side (incoming/outgoing) of an internal Ascend transfer. When both the incoming side and outgoing side of the transfer have been accepted then bookkeeping is done immediately. If neither, or only one side of a transfer is accepted, then both sides of the internal perform bookkeeping one full settlement day after they went into the bookkeeping queue.
